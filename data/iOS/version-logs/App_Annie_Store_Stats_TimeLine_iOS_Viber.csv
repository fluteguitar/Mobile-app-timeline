1.            Viber now has free text messaging!
Send and receive free text messages to and from all your Viber contacts. We’ve added a new tab called Messages. To send a text, simply select a contact from your list, and start texting for free.
New “Free Text Message” button added to Viber contact details. 
Tap this button to send this user a free message.
 
Viber will also notify you about incoming messages so you won’t miss a word single text.
 
2.            Favorites tab location changed 
To view your ‘Favorites’ - go to the contacts tab, and tap the Favorites button at the top.
 
3.            Improved calling mechanism 
Now, you’ll always know the status of your outgoing calls.
Once a call is placed, a “Calling” state will indicate that Viber is now connecting to the other party.
Once a connection is established, a “Ringing” state will indicate that the other party’s Viber, is now actually ringing (note that a call can still be established even if you don't see the ""Ringing"" state).
 
4.            Placing regular calls through Viber
A “Don’t show again” option was added for to the “Place a regular carrier call” inform dialog.
 
5.            Giving You More Control 
A new option provides the ability to deactivate your Viber account, so that you can easily reactivate Viber with a new phone number.
Find this option under the ‘More’ menu.
 
Important! Don’t kill Viber!
 
To make sure you always get incoming call/message notifications and that an incoming Viber call is rejected as ""busy"" when you're on a regular call, we strongly recommend that you to keep Viber running in the background. 
This does not drain your battery or use up memory and improves your Viber experience.
 
Bugs be-gone! 
 
1. Who has Viber?
Missed out on some Viber contacts? We’ve now improved the Viber recognition engine. So check out your Viber contact list, and see who else have has Viber.
 
2. Improved Badges
Viber badges are now more reliable and will notify you about the number of your missed calls & unread messages.
 
3. Connectivity

Viber for iPhone let’s lets you make free phone calls and send free text messages to other iPhone users that have Viber installed.

What’s New in Version 2.1
- iOS 5 compatible.
- Improved voice quality – All new Voice engine! Your calls will sound better than ever when talking to other users with Viber 2.1. Even on networks with less bandwidth, such as EDGE networks.
- Viber is now location-aware! Share your current location with your contacts so that they will know from where your message was sent. When sharing your current location, it will be attached to every outgoing message. You can enable or disable this option by tapping the location services icon inside the input box. 
- Viber now lets you send and receive Photos via Viber messages. To send photos, just tap on the ‘photos’ button, which has been added to the left of the input box.
You will now be able to take a photo, or send an existing one from your library.
- Share your photos with others - Photos can be shared on Facebook, sent via mail, and forwarded through Viber to other Viber contacts. 

User Experience
We are constantly working to improve the user experience on Viber; this involves research and analytics efforts along with reviewing your feedback.

- We changed the order of the tabs in order to improve accessibility to the ‘Messages’ section. This section contains all of your recent messages. You can now place calls right from the conversation screen.
- Know when your friend is there, and actually answering your recently sent message. New “is typing” indicator will be shown to notify you when he or she is typing a new message for you.
- Landscape support for Messages – the option you all were looking for is now supported.
- New and improved ‘Busy’ screen – if your contact is currently busy, you can simply leave him or her a free text message.
- Minor improvements to messages sending behavior - Viber will now try harder to deliver your messages: If your message was not sent, you will be notified, and you will have the option to resend it.
- We have rearranged the ‘More’ screen, and added new customization features that can be accessed via the new ‘Settings’ section.
- And of course we removed many many bugs…(and possibly added a few ☺ ).
